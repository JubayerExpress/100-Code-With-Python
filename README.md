# Python Coding Problems and Solutions

This repository contains a series of Python coding problems along with their solutions. The problems range from simple string manipulations to more complex tasks such as calculating GCD and solving mathematical problems. These solutions are intended to help learners and developers improve their problem-solving skills using Python.


## How to Run the Code

To run any solution, simply copy the relevant code into a Python file or Jupyter notebook, and execute it.

For example, to run **Problem 1** (Reverse a String), use the following Python code:

```python
# Reverse a String
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

print(reverse_string("hello"))  # Output: "olleh"
